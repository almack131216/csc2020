  text: `
      <p>Classic & Sportscar Centre is now in its 30th year of business and what a year it has been.  At a time when so much of normal life changed for everyone, our company which began trading as Grundy Mack in 1991 has carried on doing business, looking after our customers and friends in very challenging circumstances. Our business is built on relationships, reputation and experience. Customer service isn't just a slogan for us, it's a way of life which means valuing our customers and providing them with a truly memorable level of service and an experience unsurpassed in our industry.</p>      
      <p>The size of our business and scope of services has changed markedly in the past ten years. We have grown from ten to around thirty staff including those at our Malton Coachworks business, with garage services, restoration, body and paintwork, trim and upholstery work all carried out in-house.  At any time we can have 150-200 vehicles across our three premises in the Malton area. Typically we have 90+ for sale across 100 years of motoring history with something to suit every taste, with prices typically starting at £10,000 and some well into six figures. We cover many eras with a range of cars that are individual, distinctive and interesting, evoking memories of a time when the world really was a different place and a carbon footprint was something left by a miner's boot.</p>
      <p>Older cars are of course inconsistent, but we aim to prepare them to a consistently high standard. Our customers want to enjoy them, not fix them!</p>
      <p>Much has changed this year and whilst the future is more uncertain than any of us have experienced, some things remain constant. The value of integrity, honesty and building a long term reputation earned by providing exemplary service. Our values haven't changed and our 'to do' and 'to don't list remains a benchmark.</p>

      <p>The wonderful Grundy Mack customers who spent over £20,000,000 with us in the first fifteen years of business keep coming back to buy again, along with many new ones from around the world. Their good experience has brought us repeat business. We've always been a company with a strong sense of social responsibility as evidenced by our involvement with Mencap, a charity whose local chairman is our CEO James Szkiler.  When we say we care, we mean it.</p>
      <p>We buy and sell classic cars, broker their disposal for many vendors, repair, restore and renovate mechanicals, body, paint and trim. We're fast becoming <strong>THE</strong> one-stop shop for classic cars in Northern England.</p>
      <p>We believe that our amazing motoring heritage should be preserved for future generations and that classic cars will continue to have enduring appeal and considerable financial value. We see part of our responsibility as improving all those cars we buy and tell as well as teaching the skills to repair and maintain them to the next generation.</p>
